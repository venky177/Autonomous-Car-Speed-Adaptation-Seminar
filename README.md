# Autonomous Car Speed Adaptation Seminar

Every year there are millions of cases of traffic accidents pertaining to pedestrians and road users,
mainly caused due to lack of diligence from the car driver causing a serious threat to road safety.
Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) is one of latest innovations in the auto-mobile
industry and has become a premium feature in many luxury vehicles. ADAS assists drivers by
integrating multiple safety and convenience features into a single system. Current ADAS
technology usually comprises of an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system in combination with
one or more warning/prevention systems. Park autonomously, drive on highways, and take some
decisions such as lane changing, car following, and overtaking are some of the features which have
been implemented. These methodologies are implemented using a hybrid neuro-fuzzy algorithm.
Through this paper we would like to put into light a new method of autonomously adapt the speed
of the car by learning from a human driver and using anticipation. The implementation of the
system is a special fuzzy neural network namely: the Generic Self Organizing Fuzzy Neural
Network using the Yager inference scheme (GenSoFNN(Yager)).This experiment is to elaborate
and anticipate the speed constrains during curved tracks. The described system will also improve
safety of the vehicle by dynamically adjusting the speed of the ACC in accordance with the speed
limit of the road. The proposed ADAS system will be helpful in reducing speeding violations and
enhancing smoother cruise control in heavy traffic conditions and increasing efficiency during
obscure curves.
